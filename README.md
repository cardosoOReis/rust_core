# Project Goals

rust_core's primary goal is to bring Rust's features and ergonomics to Dart.

To accomplish this, Rust's functionalities are carefully adapted to Dart's paradigms, focusing on a smooth idiomatic language-compatible integration. As a result, a seamless developer experience is created for any developer using both languages, while adding powerful tools to the toolbox of any Dart developer.

True to the Rust philosophy, rust_core strives to bring reliability and performance in every feature. Every feature is robustly tested. Over 500 meaningful test suites and counting.
