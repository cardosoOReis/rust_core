`rust_core` is an implementation of Rust's Core Library in Dart.

The goal is to bring Rust's features and ergonomics to Dart. This also provides a seamless developer experience for any developer using both languages.

Rust's functionalities are carefully adapted to Dart's paradigms, focusing on a smooth idiomatic language-compatible integration with predictable control flow.

## Highlights
### Libraries

| [Array] | [Cell] | [Iter] | [Mpsc] | [Option] | [Panic] | [Result] | [Slice] | [Sync] | [Typedefs] |

ðŸ”¥ **Extensive Extensions:** Dozens of additional extensions with hundreds of methods tailored for Dart. These 
extensions are designed for maximum composability, addressing specific scenarios.

ðŸš€ **Dart Friendly:** Developed with ergonomics in mind. e.g. Dual Support for `Option` and Nullable Types. If a method or extension exists for `Option<T>`,
it's also available for `T?`.

ðŸ§ª **Robust Testing:** Every feature tested. Over 500 meaningful tests. Reliability and performance in every feature.
