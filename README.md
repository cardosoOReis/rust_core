# Rust_Core

Implementation of Rust's core library in a Dart friendly way.

Rust_Core allows for idiomatic programming in dart with predictable control flow. This is accomplished by rewriting 
the Rust core library in Dart where it makes sense, being as harmonious with the language as possible.

## Highlights
