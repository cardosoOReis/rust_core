Implementation of Rust's core library in a Dart friendly way.

rust_core allows for idiomatic programming in dart with predictable control flow. We carefully adapt Rust's 
functionalities to Dart's paradigms, ensuring a smooth, 
language-compatible integration. E.g. `Option` and Nullable types are equally supported throughout. If a method or 
extension exists for `Option<T>` it exists for `T?`. Thus, rust_core seamlessly integrates the essence of Rust's 
core library into Dart.

## Highlights
### Libraries

| [Result] | [Option] | [Cell] | [Panic] | [Typedefs]

ðŸ”¥ **Dozens of Extensions, 100's of methods:** Crafted to address specific scenarios in Dart.

ðŸ§ª **Robust Testing:** Over 300 meaningful tests, we aim for reliability and performance in every feature.

ðŸš€ **Beyond Rust Core:** While rust_core faithfully implements the Rust Core library in Dart, our vision extends further.
We aim to be an indispensable tool for every Dart project and a foundational library for the broader ecosystem.
