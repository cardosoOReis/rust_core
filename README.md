Implementing Rust's Core Library in Dart.

`rust_core` provides a Dart-friendly implementation of Rust's core library, enabling idiomatic programming with 
predictable control flow. Rust's functionalities are carefully adapted to Dart's paradigms, focusing on smooth 
and language-compatible integration.

## Highlights
### Libraries

| [Result] | [Option] | [Cell] | [Panic] | [Typedefs]

ðŸ”¥ **Extensive Extensions:** Dozens of additional extensions with hundreds of methods tailored for Dart. These 
extensions are designed for maximum composability, addressing specific scenarios.

ðŸš€ **Dart Friendly:** Dual Support for `Option` and Nullable Types. If a method or extension exists for `Option<T>`,
it's also available for `T?`, offering flexibility and consistency in your coding.

ðŸ§ª **Robust Testing:** Every feature tested. Over 300 meaningful tests. Reliability and performance in every feature.
